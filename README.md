# Kubernetes basics

This repository contains the exercises used in the kubernetes course.
It has a folder for each exercise and the solution is available in a separate directory.

The exercises can be performed in 2 different environments:
- using a real kubernetes cluster
- using [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/)/[k3s](https://k3s.io/) on your local machine

The recommendation for this course is to use a real kubernetes cluster, as this is the most realistic situation.
However, most exercises can be performed on both, only the services/persistent volumes/ingress exercises are different.
When there are separate instructions for both situation.

## Using a realworld kubernetes cluster 

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datamindedacademy/kubernetes_academy_course)

Normally, when executing in Gitpod the correct credentials are already set and you should be able to access the cluster.
Try running `kubectl get pods` to see if you have access to the cluster.

If not, you can manually set your credentials by running the following command:
- get access to the AWS account: `gp idp login aws --role-arn arn:aws:iam::338791806049:role/kubernetes-workshop-gitpod-role --duration-seconds=28800`
- configure your `.kube/config` using: `./connect_cluster.sh`

More details on how to integrate gitpod with an eks cluster can be found on the following link: https://www.gitpod.io/docs/integrations/aws

- Create a namespace for yourself and make sure to create *all resources in your own namespace* such that you do not impact each other.
  The kubens command ensures that your kube context is set to your namespaces instead of the default one.
```
kubectl create namespace <your-first-name>
kubens <select your namespace>
```

## Alternative: perform exercises locally

If you do not have a kubernetes cluster to run against, I can recommend microk8s to simulate a k8s cluster on your local machine.
More info on installing microk8s can be found at: https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started
